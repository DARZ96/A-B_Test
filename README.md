# A/B Test
###### 01/10/2019

### Summary
Used Python to clarify the results of an A/B test ran by an e-commerce website and help the company understand if they should implement a new page design.

### Datasets
For this project I explored two excel files: 

- ab_data: contained primary information of the test such as the "user_id", "timestamp", "group" (control or treatment), "landing_page" (new or old) "converted" (whether the user was converted or not)
- countries: information regarding the country of origin of the user

### Statistical Analysis 
- Bootstraping sampling distributions & p-values 
- z-score test
- Logistic regression 

### Software Requirements
- Python 3, NumPy, Pandas, StatsModels, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Credits
Big thanks to Udacity for providing all the necessary materials and content for completing this project.
